**AlcoTypo:**

\
Selecting your poison for the night is certainly a **WHISKEY** business. The pressure of supplying you and your friends with an enjoyable and very regretful night can be a daunting task. AlcoTypo; the typology of alcohol, has therefore been created to inform and enlighten you upon how the selection process is influenced through the font and overall presentation of the text. 

\
**What is typology?**

\
A brands typology is the design of the text that attracts the customer into buying that product. It is crucial as it gives the first impression as well as a hint as to what experience the consumer will gain from buying the chosen beverage. The theme should reflect the taste.

\
Good typology and font should also capture the readers attention, emit the genre of alcohol and build a sense of recognition - if the brand is well-known. This is achieved through different factors of Typeface:

\
An example could be the size of the text: the boldness of a bigger font at Cap-Height would more than likely attract more of an audience, compared to a more timid font and smaller lettering. In contrast, a delicate font could also emit a more luxurious feel for the consumer and therefore be a more appealing choice. 

\
**But why is any of this relevant to us?**

\
I shall reveal all…

\
Not only does an aesthetic and decorative bottle create a great centre piece for a future candle holder, yes we are all guilty of it, but equally it holds the responsibility of kickstarting the mood and theme of the night:

\
Will everyone be behaving as untouchable, high-class ladies or will the aim be to bring delightful disgrace upon ones family? The Typography of the brand determines the fate of those participating, often being the underlying and deciding factor as to whether the party feel the night should be a success or carnage - again we’ve **ALL** been there.

\
In addition to holding responsibility for the consumers behaviour, selecting your beverage based upon visually tasteful ornaments of doom can also save you some funds. Often we are able to spend less on a similarly appealing design. The true deciding factor then comes between the well-known brands or risking it all for the unknown, cheaper, yet extremely aesthetic choice: brand versus visuals.

\
**How I am going to help:**

These blogs will provide you with and easy way to assess different typology related to alcohol brands, when burdened with the task of providing the goods for the evening. The hope is to enable you to analyse how the presentation will be able to guarantee you a beverage to fit the theme you are relying on, as well as help you decide which brand would best accommodate your needs.
