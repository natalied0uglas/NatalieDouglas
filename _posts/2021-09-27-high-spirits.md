Whether you’re seeking a wild night out or a night to not remember, vodka might not always be a wise answer but it’s always worth a **SHOT!** 

Only one more unwise decision then remains: to place the blame upon the most befitting brand… 

Cheap and cheerful? Or Premium and proud?

\
As one unfortunately cannot taste each Vodka brand before purchasing (really **VERY** unfortunate,) the pressure to choose the culprit responsible for the next few hours mistakes befalls upon visual appeal, more specifically; it’s font.

*Grey Goose Vodka: £30.00*

The regal royal blue ‘Albertus’ font mesmerises and captivates its consumer. Promise of enticing luxury and class is what the title emits: ‘Grey Goose Vodka.’ 

Sharp symmetry provides an oddly satisfying and visually pleasing presentation, achieved through the use of equal cap-height, as well as the top title having a medium weight. When such a variation of factors is mixed like a fine cocktail, the result is garnished with the appearance of a slight gravitational pull when jumbled within the ‘Albertus’ font, painting a bold and powerful visual - truly an appealing thought for a wild night out!

\
In contrast to this outlined title, the blessed noun of glory is then found in light weighted and low contrasted lettering: **‘VODKA,’** contradicting the top title with a more delicate and alluring aesthetic. Politely placed between two thin lines, the stretched lettering offers a certain high status appeal, later confirmed at the bottom of the bottle in monospaced and extended lettering, is printed: IMPORTED, (that’s how you **KNOW** it must be high end.) 

However fancy this all may seem, the idea of paying £30 for a good night as opposed to splashing the cash on ‘Deliveroo’ food can seem rather preposterous. In such a case, it is always an intelligent idea to assess  and compare the ‘cheap and cheerful’ brands, as well as the luxury.

*Smirnoff Vodka: £12.75*

White lettering in bold ‘Russian Quality' font is cushioned by a rebellious red background and laced with a gold boarder. This strong, eye catching brand’s use of boldness visually guarantees a strong hangover for the following morning (a VERY good sign for a VERY successful night.) In high cap-height and highly contrasted letters, the overall shape of the title creates and oval effect, with each end appearing to be slightly tugged downwards. Having this minor change in angle draws the eye, as it contradicts the natural shape of the tall bottle. One could therefore be drawn to such a label with the initial thought of thinking the slanting of characters was a mistake on the branding behalf. However, this purposeful position ensures we linger long enough to consider purchasing our poison for the night.
