‘Wine:’ ‘an alcoholic drink made from fermented grape juice.’

A better definition of ‘wine:’ the way forward to being head over toilet seat, crying about some unfortunate soul who’m you refer to as your ‘ex.’

Granted, more refined individuals may prefer a classy approach and enjoy merely a splash of the blood red poison, however that is usually due to the outstanding price. Allow me to explain; the cheaper the bottle, the more booze that flows - as well as the term ‘oh just a dash more dearest…’

**Casillero Del Diablo: £6.00**

Presented in English Towne Medium Font - the very resemblance of an old English Newspapers - the title is presented at x-height in bold lettering, the word ‘del’ being in a smaller font to ensure at a glance the costumer will remember the label. To further enhance the two key words, their initials are highlighted in red, a tone that reflects the black cherry flavours known to be used throughout their brand. Unlike ‘del’ - who really must be feeling left out by now, both initials ‘C’ and ‘D’ are in capitals, allowing the opposing ‘stress’ of the letters to flow aesthetically from one another.

To add a slight contrast to the title, gold shadowing encases the letters, creating a certain charm and hint of luxury to the overall presentation. The appearance, although simple does radiate an old, victorian visual for the customer and does achieve an eye catching title with its heavy weighted and proportionally spaced characters that contain ‘stress’ throughout. However, it does not give off the feel of luxury, as is reflected by the price.

**Château Mouton Rothschild 2014: £2,650.00** - no I did not add in an extra zero...

An extreme price certainly deserves an extremely elegant and visually pleasing display, which is exactly what the label offers! The font shows drastically rounded strokes and stress within the lettering, as well as a thin and light weight appearance. This choice of characteristics emits effortless class and elegance. With a slight hint of Italics, gold - a truly appropriate colour for such a wine - lettering ensures the customer is immediately informed of its worth. This dry and highly acidic wine is paired with an original illustration from David Hockney, allowing the price to certainly earned. If one is searching for a wine for a messy night, this certainly would not be one to waste!
