Whether its been a long day, a lovely hot morning or simply arranging to see friends, you never can go wrong with a refreshing, frothy pint. 

But which beverage will serve you best? That purely depends on who’s company you keep, after all, beauty is in the eye of the BEERholder…



**Heineken: £2.00**

In bold and heavy-weight lettering reads the words of glory and relief - depending on your taste: Heineken. To separate the white lettering further and add depth from the dark green background, the letters are rimmed with a subtly lighter green to add emphasise and attention to the title. 

If you, like myself, are a true beer phonetic you will notice that the company have in fact developed their branding since it was first introduced. No longer in all capitals and added ‘foot’ to each letter to give a more polished look, the label achieves a sense of typographic sophistication. However, true progress was made now known as the iconic “laughing E,” changing it to having a sloped crossbar. This breaks up the otherwise, long and forgettable name to ensure the viewer remembers and spots the minor, yet effective detail.

**Belgian Goose island: £145.00**

In bold, gothic themed font, this dark-themed; brown and gold, label offers a unique vintage feel for the consumer. To enhance this, weed-like branches appear to be stemming form certain characters - a feature that personally reminds one of the animated film: Snow White. The medium weight however, as well as the sandwiched characters are arched, creating a more lifted and less heavy feel to the overall brand. 

The subtitle however, takes a more statement, polished appearance, monospaced to clearly state the contents. The contrasts against the main title and further ‘lifts’ the overall presentation if the text. 

Overall, the branding takes a rustic and gothic themed approach, reflecting the bitter-sweet taset, through the use of colouring and spacing.
