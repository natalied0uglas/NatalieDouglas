An appeal to rum was first introduced to families through the very humorous character: Captain Jack Sparrow… one could speculate that consuming straight up rum without a mixer is not as appealing as he makes it appear, nor as easy to swallow. 

Nevertheless, however you choose to take your rum, it must be noted that the price range on the market displays a broad range of figures…



**Malibu: £11.99**

A personal favourite, this coconut infused rum is displayed upon any shelf of any supermarket in bold, cap-height and brown lettering. Printed upon a white bottle, the colouring along with the illustration successfully lure customers into 0.05 seconds of holiday - truly such a trap could be considered cruel when one is stuck in England.

To highlight this illustration the structure of the heavy weight title is displayed as an arch, hovering like a sunset over the circled image. To further is bold appearance, the font is in high stress to add contrast, furthering the depth of it’s visual aesthetic.

The subtitle - consisting of one to-the-point sentence, is carried in a similar font, thought with no stress and in a smaller manner. The simplistic design allows the customer to gain the immediate tropical theme for the bottle, as well as the tropical taste that assists it.

**Courvoisier: £93.55**

Unlike most branding and marketing techniques, this particular beverage does not rely on its title to be the boldest and most eye catching part of the label. Instead, in a bigger, cap height, yet light font, the ‘XO,’ (extra old,) takes the centre of the label. This highlights the main aspect of worth for the bottle, immediately revealing its high status of luxury to the customer.

The title is minority monospaced, with extreme stress on the ‘R,’ drawing the eye to the subtle detail and thus allowing the brand to gain more of the buyers time. A purple background cushions the white lettering, enhancing the elegance whilst reflecting the rum’s velvet texture. Overall, the characters are all of equal cap height and stress.
